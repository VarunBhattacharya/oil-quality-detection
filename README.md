# **oilQuad**: To measure engine oil viscosity for efficient tracking of engine health


**oilQuad** is a system which uses a custom viscometric device to determine car oil change intervals and sends information to a shared cloud from where the mandate persons can access that data and can take the necessary actions regarding it.

### **Business Problem**
Frequently, it is a prevalent practice to adhere to fixed time intervals when considering the replacement of car engine oil for the purpose of enhancing performance. However, this approach rooted in assumed time intervals can be characterized as inefficient, potentially detrimental to the vehicle's performance, and financially burdensome. There exists a significant concern that the engine oil may not necessarily require replacement before the stipulated time interval, or conversely, it may be necessary to do so after the designated timeframe. The primary issue at hand pertains to the determination of whether an immediate oil change is warranted in order to sustain optimal performance levels of the vehicle.

### **Requirements**
- Car Engine Oil Tube
- Viscosity Sensor (Thermal Sensors)
- MLX 90614 infrared sensor
- Microprocessor (in-built in car internal system)
- Shared Cloud Platform (for data storage and accessibility)
- Car engine oil viscosity rating details (e.g., 10W, 30)
- Car Owner and Dealership details (for notifications)

### **Installation Procedure**
- Installation of a viscosity sensor within or external to the car engine oil tube through non-invasive techniques to facilitate the measurement of oil viscosity and temperature.

- Acquisition of signals from these sensors and their transmission to a dedicated microprocessor.

- Integration of the microprocessor within the vehicle's internal system to facilitate the transmission of collected data to a shared cloud platform.

- Establishment of a shared cloud infrastructure for data storage and accessibility.

- Data retention in the shared cloud, with notifications provided to both the car owner and dealership based on the car engine oil viscosity rating (e.g., 10W, 30), which includes values for both hot and cold conditions. Notifications are triggered based on the historical trends in oil viscosity, prompting necessary actions as warranted.
